# burger-stacker
first game project
Burger stacker tests your burger making skills.
click the burger ingredients to select and put them in the burger, match them to the example burger in the top left and have fun. 

Objective

i wanted to create a simple game to show how much i have learned in this 2 weeks of coding. i feel that this game has some potential real world applications.

MVP
simple matching game that can be modified to suit different themes

challenges

as i am still new to coding, i met with a few speedbumps along the way. getting the initial functions to run properly took me some time and i feel that it could be written more efficiently. However everything works!

i will probably revisit this project later on to see how i could improve on it.
